Brief Summary:
In the function called 'StrategyGetBuffer', we modified the strategy which the function uses to get the most recently used buffer. And let the function pick and return the newest buffer from the pool for each call. We used the times of replacement as timestamp of a buffer.

Detailed Changes:
1. <Modified File 1>: <The path of the modified file from src directory>
	- <Detailed changes of the file>.
	For example: In line xxx, I make a change so that the buffer will do........
